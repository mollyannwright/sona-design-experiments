# Compliance Dashboard - Low Fidelity Wireframe

A low-fidelity wireframe version of the compliance dashboard focusing on layout, hierarchy, and component placement.

## Design Principles

This wireframe follows low-fidelity guidelines:
- **Grey-scale only** - No colors, only shades of gray (slate palette)
- **Chalkboard font** - Applied to all text elements for a sketchy, wireframe feel
- **Squiggle lines** - Used for paragraph blocks of text (not implemented in this version as we use actual text)
- **Actual text** - Headers, labels, table cells, buttons, and counts use real text
- **Simple boxes** - Gray boxes with `bg-slate-100` and `border-slate-300`
- **Placeholder text** - Uses `text-slate-400` for secondary text

## Features
