# Labour Rules - Low Fidelity Wireframe Prototype

A simplified wireframe version of the Labour Rules configuration interface, focusing on layout, hierarchy, and component placement.

## Purpose

This low-fidelity prototype demonstrates:
- **Layout structure** - How the four main tabs are organized
- **Component hierarchy** - What elements appear where
- **Information architecture** - How data is grouped and displayed
- **User flow** - Navigation between different views

## Design Approach

Following wireframe best practices:
- **Simple gray boxes** (`bg-slate-100`, `border-slate-300`) instead of styled components
- **Placeholder text** (`text-slate-400`) to indicate content areas
- **Minimal styling** to emphasize structure over visual polish
- **Clear annotations** showing what each area represents

## Four Main Tabs

1. **Attributes** - Define org-level attributes (time, boolean, integer, float, string)
2. **Org Unit Attributes** - Set attribute values per site (bulk edit table)
3. **Rulesets & Rules** - Create rulesets with formula-based rules
4. **Assignments** - Assign rulesets to sites with date ranges

## Route

Accessible at: `/labour-rules-low-fi`

## Comparison

Compare this wireframe with the high-fidelity version at `/labour-rules` to see:
- How structure translates to polished UI
- What visual elements enhance usability
- How spacing and typography improve readability
