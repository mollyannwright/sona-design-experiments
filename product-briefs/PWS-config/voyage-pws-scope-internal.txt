1. Executive summary
This document defines the complete scope for PWS (People We Support) management and commissioned hours functionality within Sona for the Voyage Care implementation. These capabilities form the foundation for Voyage's registered care delivery model.
1.1 The problem
Voyage currently manages care hours and PWS details in spreadsheets maintained by finance teams, separate from their rostering solution. This creates:
* Manual data entry burden and reconciliation overhead
* Risk of misalignment between planned care and commissioned hours
* Inability to proactively monitor ratio compliance
* Limited visibility into safe staffing levels during scheduling
* Difficulty tracking actual delivery against commissioned requirements
1.2 The solution
Move all PWS configuration and commissioned hours data into Sona, providing integrated care planning, scheduling, and compliance monitoring within a single platform.
1.3 Scope summary
This document covers three integrated deliverables:
1. PWS Enhancements Part 1 — Foundational data structures and configuration capabilities
2. Commissioned Hours Enhancements — Ratio management and shared care calculations
3. PWS Weekly View — Operational roster interface with enhanced metrics and visibility
1.4 Critical dependencies
* Dynamics CRM integration (Community phase) — will eventually provide PWS data feed
* Until integration: Manual data entry via enhanced Sona configuration screens
* Weekly View roster platform (modern technology foundation)
________________


2. Background & context
2.1 Business context
Voyage delivers care to individuals (PWS) under commissioning arrangements with local authorities and other funding bodies. Each PWS has specific care requirements defined in care packages, including allocated hours and required staffing ratios.
Currently, this critical information exists outside the rostering system, forcing care managers to cross-reference multiple sources when planning schedules.
2.2 Current state pain points
* Care package details maintained in finance spreadsheets
* Schedulers lack visibility of commissioned hours during roster planning
* No system-level tracking of ratio requirements
* Care needs documented separately from scheduling
* Manual processes to verify staffing meets commissioned requirements
2.3 Expected business impact
* Single source of truth for PWS care requirements
* Proactive compliance monitoring during schedule creation
* Reduced administrative overhead (eliminate spreadsheet reconciliation)
* Improved audit trail for regulatory compliance
* Foundation for accurate cost-per-PWS reporting
________________


3. Objectives
3.1 Primary objectives
* Enable storage and management of all PWS commissioned hours data within Sona
* Provide automated ratio calculation and compliance monitoring
* Deliver a modern, PWS-centric roster interface for care managers
* Track hours consumption against commissioned budgets in real time
3.2 Secondary objectives
* Establish data structures that support future Dynamics CRM integration
* Enable care needs matching between PWS requirements and employee skills
* Provide comprehensive reporting and data export capabilities
* Support template-based scheduling for operational efficiency

5. Detailed requirements: Part 1 — PWS Enhancements
This section covers the two distinct configuration levels required for PWS management:
Level 1: Service/Location Configuration — Settings that apply to an entire care home or service
Level 2: PWS Configuration — Settings specific to each individual person we support
5.1 Service/location configuration
Each service (org unit representing a care home or location) requires configuration that governs how care is delivered across all PWS at that location.
5.1.1 Service settings
Field name
	Data type
	Description
	Example
	Service Capacity
	Integer
	Maximum number of PWS the service can accommodate
	12
	Target Ratio
	Ratio (1:X)
	Aspirational staffing ratio the service aims to achieve
	1:6
	Controlling Ratio
	Ratio (1:X)
	Auto-calculated from PWS — most restrictive ratio drives this
	1:4
	Day Period Start
	Time
	When day care period begins
	07:00
	Night Period Start
	Time
	When night care period begins
	22:00
	Distribution Method
	Enum
	How shared hours are allocated across PWS (Equal / Percentage / Ratio-weighted)
	Equal
	5.1.2 How controlling ratio works
The controlling ratio is automatically calculated by the system — it is not manually set. The system:
* Looks at all PWS currently 'In Service' at the location
* Identifies each PWS's individual ratio requirement
* Sets the controlling ratio to the most restrictive (lowest number)
* Recalculates automatically when PWS are added, removed, or their ratio changes
Example: If a service has 5 PWS at 1:6 and 1 PWS at 1:4, the controlling ratio is 1:4. That one PWS 'controls' the staffing requirement for the whole service during shared care.
5.1.3 Service validation rules
Field
	Validation
	Service Capacity
	Must be positive integer. Warning displayed if current PWS count exceeds capacity.
	Target Ratio
	Format 1:X where X is positive integer. Allowed values configurable (e.g. 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10).
	Day/Night boundaries
	Night start must be after day start. No overlapping periods.
	________________


5.2 PWS configuration
Each PWS (Person We Support) requires their own configuration defining their care package, needs, and status.
5.2.1 Core PWS fields
Field name
	Data type
	Description
	Example
	PWS Name
	String
	Full name of the person
	David Thompson
	PWS ID Code
	String (50)
	Unique identifier for reporting and finance
	VYG-PWS-047
	Primary Service
	Service Link
	The service/location where this PWS resides
	Maple House
	Individual Ratio
	Ratio (1:X)
	This PWS's specific shared care ratio requirement
	1:4
	Occupancy Status
	Enum
	Current status: In Service / Out of Service
	In Service
	Admission Date
	Date
	When the PWS was admitted to the service
	01/03/2024
	5.2.2 Commissioned hours
Each PWS has a care package defining their weekly commissioned hours. These hours are broken down by type:
Hour type
	Hours/week
	Ratio
	Description
	1:1 Care
	Decimal
	N/A (always 1:1)
	Dedicated individual care — one staff member exclusively with this PWS
	2:1 Care
	Decimal
	N/A (always 2:1)
	Two staff members supporting this one PWS (complex needs)
	Shared Care Day
	Decimal
	Uses individual ratio
	Day-time care shared with other PWS at this service
	Shared Care Night
	Decimal
	Uses individual ratio
	Night-time care shared with other PWS at this service
	Waking Night
	Decimal
	Uses individual ratio
	Night hours where staff must remain awake
	Sleeping Night
	Decimal
	Uses individual ratio
	Night hours where staff sleeps on-site but available if needed
	Note: The 'Individual Ratio' set on the PWS applies to all shared care hour types. This ratio feeds into the service's controlling ratio calculation.
5.2.3 Care needs
Each PWS can have care needs specified, which map to required employee skills:
* Care needs use the existing Skills/Attributes framework
* Each care need links to a required employee skill
* When scheduling, system checks if assigned employee has the required skills
* Visual warnings shown when employee lacks skills required by the PWS
PWS care need
	Required employee skill
	Requires hoist
	Hoist Trained
	Diabetic
	Diabetes Care
	Complex medication
	Medication Administration Level 3
	Behavioural support required
	Positive Behaviour Support
	PEG feeding
	PEG Feed Trained
	5.2.4 PWS validation rules
Field
	Validation
	PWS ID Code
	Must be unique across organisation. Required field.
	Individual Ratio
	Format 1:X where X is positive integer. Must be from allowed list.
	Commissioned Hours
	Cannot be negative. Warning if total exceeds 168 hours/week.
	Primary Service
	Must link to valid service. PWS counts against that service's capacity.
	________________


5.3 Occupancy management
PWS may be temporarily absent from their service (hospital admission, respite care, holiday). The system needs to track this because:
* Absent PWS should not drive scheduling demand
* Their ratio should not affect the controlling ratio calculation
* Hours consumption should pause during absence
* Audit trail needed for billing and compliance
5.3.1 Occupancy record structure
Field
	Type
	Description
	PWS
	Reference
	Link to PWS record
	Out of Service Date
	Date
	When PWS left the service
	Expected Return Date
	Date (optional)
	When PWS is expected back
	Reason
	Enum
	Hospital / Respite / Holiday / Family Visit / Other
	Notes
	Text
	Additional context
	5.3.2 Occupancy status behaviour
* PWS defaults to 'In Service' status
* Creating an occupancy record with a date range sets status to 'Out of Service'
* System excludes 'Out of Service' PWS from controlling ratio calculation
* System excludes their hours from scheduling demand
* When return date passes, status automatically reverts to 'In Service'
* Historical records maintained for audit and billing reconciliation
5.4 Configuration hierarchy summary
The relationship between service and PWS configuration:
Level
	What you configure
	What system calculates
	Service
	Capacity, target ratio, day/night times, distribution method
	Controlling ratio (from PWS), total commissioned hours, current occupancy
	PWS
	Individual ratio, commissioned hours by type, care needs, occupancy periods
	Hours consumed, skill match status, whether they 'control' the ratio
	________________
5.5 Bulk operations
* CSV import for initial PWS data migration
* Bulk update individual ratios across multiple PWS
* Copy commissioned hours structure from one PWS to another
* Bulk update occupancy status (e.g. mark multiple PWS as returned)
________________


6. Detailed requirements: Part 2 — Commissioned Hours
6.1 The ratio challenge
Voyage's commissioned care hours include 'shared care' where multiple PWS receive care simultaneously. The complexity arises because:
* Different PWS have different needs — some require closer supervision (1:4) while others can share care more widely (1:6)
* Controlling ratio rule — when PWS with different ratios receive shared care together, the most restrictive ratio applies
* Service-wide impact — one PWS with higher needs can change the entire service's staffing requirement
* Hour allocation complexity — shared hours must be distributed across PWS, but distribution methods may vary
6.2 Controlling ratio calculation
6.2.1 Algorithm
For each service:
* Identify all PWS with shared care hours
* Extract individual ratio for each PWS
* Determine most restrictive ratio (lowest number on right side)
* Set as Controlling Ratio for service
* Flag which PWS drive the controlling ratio
6.2.2 Example scenarios
Scenario
	PWS ratios
	Controlling
	Reason
	All same
	1:6, 1:6, 1:6
	1:6
	No more restrictive ratio
	Mixed
	1:6, 1:4, 1:6
	1:4
	1:4 is more restrictive
	Very mixed
	1:8, 1:6, 1:2, 1:4
	1:2
	1:2 is most restrictive
	6.3 Staff hours calculation
6.3.1 Formula
Staff Hours Required = Sum of (PWS Shared Hours) ÷ Controlling Ratio
6.3.2 Worked examples
Scenario 1: All PWS at 1:6
* PWS 1: 100 hours @ 1:6
* PWS 2: 100 hours @ 1:6
* PWS 3: 100 hours @ 1:6
* Total PWS hours: 300, Controlling ratio: 1:6
Staff hours needed: 300 ÷ 6 = 50 hours
Scenario 2: Mixed ratios (controlling 1:4)
* PWS 1: 100 hours @ 1:6
* PWS 2: 100 hours @ 1:6
* PWS 3: 100 hours @ 1:6
* PWS 4: 100 hours @ 1:4 (controls)
* Total PWS hours: 400, Controlling ratio: 1:4
Staff hours needed: 400 ÷ 4 = 100 hours
6.4 Time-based ratio variations
Ratios may differ between day and night, and night-time may involve sleeping staff.
Hour type
	Time period
	Ratio
	Staff status
	Notes
	Shared Day
	07:00-22:00
	1:6
	Awake
	Day care
	Shared Night
	22:00-07:00
	1:8
	Waking
	Staff awake all night
	Shared Night
	22:00-07:00
	1:10
	Sleeping
	Staff sleeps, counts when woken
	System determines controlling ratio separately for each time period.
6.5 Shared hours distribution methods
6.5.1 Method 1: Equal distribution
All PWS receive equal share of total hours.
Example: Total 240 hours/week, 4 PWS = 60 hours each
When to use: All PWS have similar needs and support requirements.
6.5.2 Method 2: Percentage-based distribution
Each PWS receives a defined percentage of total hours.
Example: PWS 1: 25% (60h), PWS 2: 25% (60h), PWS 3: 30% (72h), PWS 4: 20% (48h)
When to use: PWS have different levels of need requiring proportional allocation.
6.5.3 Method 3: Ratio-weighted distribution
Hours distributed based on individual ratio requirements (more restrictive ratio = more hours).
When to use: PWS with higher care needs should receive proportionally more shared care time.
6.6 Shift-level PWS coverage
Each shift can specify which PWS are covered, enabling:
* Accurate hours consumption tracking per PWS
* Ratio calculation based on actual PWS present
* Care needs validation against assigned employee skills
* Override capability for non-standard situations
6.7 Hours consumption tracking
For each PWS, track consumption against commissioned budget:
* Weekly view shows hours scheduled vs commissioned by type
* Visual indicators: Green (<80%), Amber (80-100%), Red (>100% over-allocated)
* Real-time update as shifts are created/modified
________________


7. Detailed requirements: Part 3 — PWS Weekly View
7.1 Technology migration
Rebuild PWS view on modern weekly view roster platform (same technology as standard weekly view).
7.1.1 Feature parity requirements
Bring forward all modern weekly view capabilities:
* Drag-and-drop shift scheduling
* Drag-and-drop shift reassignment between staff
* Absence and sickness management
* Open shifts functionality
* Advanced edit functions (bulk operations)
* Real-time save and update
* Undo/redo capability
* Filter and search functions
7.2 View modes
7.2.1 Primary view: Service-based with PWS breakdown
Shows service at top with metrics panel, then individual PWS rows with their scheduled shifts across the week. Each PWS row displays:
* PWS name and individual ratio
* Commissioned hours summary
* Visual indication if PWS drives controlling ratio
* Out of service status where applicable
* Shifts scheduled per day with hours breakdown
7.2.2 Individual PWS drill-down
Clicking on a PWS row expands to show detailed shift information including:
* Shift times and types
* Assigned employee
* Other PWS covered by the shift
* Ratio compliance status
* Skill match status
* Hours consumed from budget

7.3 Service metrics panel
Always visible panel at top of roster view showing:
Metric
	Description
	Ratio Status
	Within Safe Limits / Outside Safe Limits / Understaffed
	Target Ratio
	Organisational goal for the service
	Controlling Ratio
	Actual requirement based on PWS (identifies which PWS drives it)
	Current Staffing
	Ratio achieved based on scheduled shifts
	Commissioned Hours
	Total for the week across all hour types
	Scheduled Hours
	Total scheduled with percentage and variance
	PWS Status
	Count in service vs out of service
	Care Needs Compliance
	Whether all shifts have appropriately skilled staff
	7.4 Drag-and-drop with validation
PWS-specific validations during drag operations:
Moving shift to different PWS
   * Check shift type compatible with target PWS's commissioned hours
   * Check target PWS has remaining hour budget
   * Warn if target PWS has different ratio requirement
   * Allow user to add staff, cancel, or override with reason
Moving shift to different day
   * Check employee available on new day
   * Auto-remove PWS who are out of service on that day
   * Recalculate ratio requirement based on remaining PWS
Reassigning to different employee
   * Check new employee availability
   * Validate skills against PWS care needs
   * Show warning if employee lacks required skills, allow override
7.5 Shift creation workflow
Enhanced shift creation dialog includes:
   * Date, start/end time selection
   * Shift type selection
   * PWS coverage checkboxes with ratio and hours status for each
   * Calculated requirements panel (controlling ratio, staff required)
   * Employee selection with skill matching
   * Care needs required summary
   * Hours impact preview per PWS
   * Template save/apply options
7.6 Employee skill matching interface
When 'Show Compatible Employees' clicked, display employees sorted by match quality:
Match status
	Display
	Perfect match
	Employee has all required skills, available, has hours remaining. [Assign] button.
	Partial match
	Employee has some skills, missing others. Shows which skills missing. [Assign with Override] button.
	No match
	Employee lacks all required skills or unavailable. Cannot assign.

	Warning (Amber)
	Skill mismatch
	Employee lacks required skill: Diabetes Care.
	Info (Blue)
	Overstaffing
	Service has excess staff. Required: 1, Scheduled: 2.
	7.8 Template management
7.8.1 Template structure
   * Template name
   * Shift type and duration
   * PWS coverage (which PWS included)
   * Ratio applied
   * Assigned staff (optional)
   * Day of week / recurrence pattern (optional)
7.8.2 Template application
When applying templates, system:
   * Pre-fills shifts with template settings
   * Auto-adjusts for out-of-service PWS
   * Recalculates ratios based on actual PWS present
   * Allows modification before saving
   * Validates all constraints and shows warnings

Data flow TO Sona
   * PWS master data (identifiers, details, status)
   * Commissioned hours (types, amounts, dates)
   * Occupancy changes (out of service dates, reasons)
   * Care needs updates and ratio requirements
Data flow FROM Sona
   * Confirmed shifts with PWS coverage
   * Hours consumption by PWS and type
   * Ratio compliance status
   * Variance analysis
Configuration change: Admin interface becomes 'view-only' for Dynamics-sourced data with manual override capability for exceptions.
9.2 Nourish care documentation
Future integration to link care needs to care documentation:
   * Care plan in Nourish → Care needs in Sona
   * Shift completion in Sona → Care documentation prompt in Nourish
   * Quality metrics from Nourish → Display in Sona metrics
9.3 Payroll integration
PWS Weekly View confirmed shifts can feed to payroll with:
   * Shift type → Pay rate category
   * Duration → Hours worked
   * PWS coverage → Cost allocation
   * Service → Cost centre
________________


10. Assumptions
   * Modern weekly view platform is stable and available for PWS view migration
   * Existing Skills/Attributes framework can be extended for PWS care needs
   * Voyage will provide current spreadsheet data for migration and validation
   * Voyage finance team available for UAT of configuration interfaces
   * Voyage care managers available for UAT of PWS weekly view
   * Ratio requirements and distribution methods are consistent across Voyage services
   * Dynamics integration architecture is defined before Phase 1 completion
   * No major changes to commissioned hours structure during development

Appendix B: Example scenarios
Scenario 1: New PWS admission
Step 1: Finance enters PWS details
   * Name: David Thompson
   * Service: Oak Grove House
   * PWS ID: VYG-PWS-047
   * Admission Date: March 1, 2026
Step 2: Configure commissioned hours
   * 1:1 Care: 21 hours/week
   * Shared Care: 84 hours/week @ 1:6 ratio
   * Waking Night: 14 hours/week @ 1:8 ratio
Step 3: Specify care needs
   * Mobility: Wheelchair user, requires hoist
   * Medical: Epilepsy monitoring
   * Communication: Non-verbal, uses picture cards
Step 4: Care manager plans schedule
   * Opens PWS weekly view
   * System shows David's commissioned hours
   * Creates shifts with appropriate PWS coverage
   * System validates: Employees must have Hoist + Epilepsy skills
   * Assigns skilled employees to David's shifts
Scenario 2: Ratio complexity in mixed service
Willowbrook Service has 6 PWS:
   * Anna: 100h shared @ 1:8 (low needs)
   * Ben: 100h shared @ 1:6 (moderate needs)
   * Clara: 100h shared @ 1:6 (moderate needs)
   * David: 100h shared @ 1:4 (higher needs — behavioural support)
   * Emma: 100h shared @ 1:6 (moderate needs)
   * Frank: 100h shared @ 1:8 (low needs)
System calculations
   * Target Ratio: 1:6 (organisational goal)
   * Controlling Ratio: 1:4 (driven by David's needs)
   * Total PWS shared hours: 600 hours
   * Staff hours required: 600 ÷ 4 = 150 staff hours
If David were not in service:
   * Controlling ratio would become 1:6 (Ben, Clara, Emma)
   * Staff hours required: 500 ÷ 6 = 83.33 staff hours
   * Significant difference: 66.67 fewer staff hours needed
